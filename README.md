# 📊 **Diagonal Difference Calculator** 📊

This Python script computes the absolute difference between the sums of the primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix. The script takes matrix input from the user, calculates the diagonal differences, 
and writes the result to an output file.

# 🔍 **Code Highlights:**

- **Module Imports:** Importing essential modules like `math`, `os`, `random`, `re`, and `sys` to enable mathematical operations, file handling, randomness, regular expressions, and system-specific parameters.

- **Diagonal Sums:** The `diagonalDifference` function iterates through the matrix using nested loops. It calculates the sums of elements on the primary and secondary diagonals concurrently.

- **Input and Output:** The script reads the size of the matrix and its elements from the user. The calculated diagonal difference is then written to an output file specified by the `OUTPUT_PATH` environment

  variable.

# 🔧 **Usage:**


1. Install Python (if not already installed).

2. Run the script in your terminal or preferred Python environment.

3. Enter the matrix size and elements as prompted.

4. The diagonal difference will be displayed and saved in the output file.

# 🛠️ **Customization:**

Feel free to modify the script for your specific needs:


- Adjust the matrix size and elements to suit your input requirements.

- Modify the logic inside the `diagonalDifference` function for different diagonal-related computations.

# 🚀 **Takeaway:**

This script showcases how to perform matrix operations and interact with files using Python. It's a versatile starting point for various matrix-related calculations, making it a valuable addition to your coding 
toolbox.
